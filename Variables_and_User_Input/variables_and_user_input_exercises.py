# # # Q1. Write a program that takes two numbers from the user and outputs their sum.
# answer1 = input("Enter a number: ")
# print(answer1)
# answer2 = input("Enter another number: ")
# calculation = (float(answer1) + float(answer2))
# print(calculation)

# Q2. Write a program that takes two numbers from the user and outputs the equation representing the multiplication of the two numbers. 
# answer1 = input("Enter a number: ")
# print(answer1)
# answer2 = input("Enter another number: ")
# calculation = (float(answer1) * float(answer2))
# print(f"{answer1} * {answer2} = {calculation}")
# num1 = input("Please enter first number: ") #user input1
# num2 = input("Please enter second number: ") #user input2
# num1 = float(num1)
# num2 = float(num2)
# answer = num1 * num2 #calculation and to float
# print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {answer}") #output to string


# Q3. Write a program that takes a distance in kilometers from the user,and output the distance in meters and centimeters.
# km = input("How many kilometers? ")
# calculation = (int(float(km) * 1000))
# print(f"{km} km = {calculation}m")
# calculation2 = (int(float(km) * 100000))
# print(f"{km} km = {calculation2}cm")

# # #Q4. Write a program that takes the user's name and height (in cm) and outputs a summary sentence.
# # name = input("What is your name? ")
# # height = input("How tall are you (cms)? ")
# # print(f"{name} is {height}cms tall.")
